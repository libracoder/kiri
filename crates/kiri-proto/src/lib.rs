//! Wire protocol between the Kiri host and the guest agent.
//!
//! Every frame is `len: u32 LE | kind: u16 LE | payload`, where `len` counts
//! `kind` plus `payload`. Encoding writes into a caller-owned buffer and
//! decoding borrows from one, so steady-state traffic never allocates.
//!
//! Strings are `u32 len | bytes`; string lists are `u32 count | strings`.
//! A [`Msg::LayerBegin`] frame is followed by exactly `size` raw bytes of the
//! layer blob, outside any frame, so bulk data is never copied into frames.
